=
A Simple Discord RPC tool designed for alerting your friends of when you are asleep and when you are awake;
It is `fully customizable` via the configuration file from the `Application ID` right down to your `sleeping & awake` pattern;

`sleepTime` array works like;
`Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday` and `Saturday` 

`[23, 8]` 
first number is when you go to sleep (the hour you go to sleep 23 = 11PM)
second number is when you wake up (the hour you wake up 8 = 8AM)

`awakeTime` array works like;
`Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday` and `Saturday` 

`[8, 23]` 
first number is when you wake up (the hour you wake up 8 = 8AM)
second number is when you go to sleep (the hour you go to sleep 23 = 11PM)
